# Building an MVP

## Requirements:

1. Play the first few chords
2. Show colored flags

## Design constraints:

1. No login required
2. Easy to maintain and deploy
3. No backend
4. Cross-platform

## Approach:

1. Use an online keyboard to record audio files for the relevant chords
2. Build a static site with `jekyll` and host on GitHub Pages

             class="screenshot"
             alt="Same screenshot as before, but with just one red rectangle."
                  />
    </div>
</div>

Notes:

- Found an online piano website and used a loopback device to record the chords
- Stored some information in `localStorage` to persist a session if the page is refreshed

**Feedback:**

- Needed a way to play chords manually
- Son had basically no motivation to pay attention or get correct answers
